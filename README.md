# Curva

Curva is a pure math framework for curve building and analysis, which is still under development.

#Application

It is not intended to be an engineering software... However, it may serve as a mathematical solution to generate motion curves for engineering applications which involve delicate control of the motion of a moving object. Based on the motion curves, further analysis of the dynamics of the system can be performed. With iterations, a motion curve that best suit the application can be achieved.
  
  Such an application may include:
- robotic arm
- electric cam
- physical cam-follower

with key features as:
- suitable for both translative motion (displacement vs time) and swing motion (angle vs time).
- able to excert control of displacement, velocity, acceleration (motion and it's derivatives) over any range of the motion.
- flexible to add analysis toolkits, such as FFT module to give real-time frequency analysis during curve building(dragging). 

#About

A large amount of the author's personal time is devoted to this tool, going from mathematical model to calculation algorithm, and finally to a working program. Simplicity, interactivity and flexibility are the main focus. 

However it is still at early stage, more features are yet to be added, existing features need to be refined. Any comments, suggestions are greatly appreciated. I am ready to discuss with you if you're interested.
