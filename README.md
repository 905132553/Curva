# Curva

  Curva is a pure math tool for curve building and analysis. It is not intended to be an engineering software. 
  However, it may serve as the motion designer for an engineering application which requires delicate motion control of a moving object, and as the basis to perform further analysis of the dynamics of the system. 
  Such an application may include:
1. robotic arm
2. electric cam
3. physical cam-follower
  With key features as:
1. suitable for both translative motion (displacement VS time or angle) and swing motion (angle VS time).
2. able to excert control of displacement, velocity, acceleration (motion and it's derivatives) over any range of the motion.

  A large amount of the owner's personal time is devoted to this tool, aiming to surpass any other tools in the field in terms of simplicity, interactivity and flexibility. 
  However it is still at primal stage, more features are yet to be added or refined. Any comments, suggestions and critiques are greatly appreciated.
